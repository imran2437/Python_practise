A linear data structure is a type of data structure in which data elements are organized sequentially, one after the other. In a linear data structure, each element has a unique predecessor (except for the first element) and a unique successor (except for the last element). This sequential arrangement makes it easy to traverse the data structure from one end to the other.

The key characteristics of linear data structures include:

    Sequential Organization: Elements are arranged in a specific order, and each element has a defined predecessor and successor.

    Single Entry and Single Exit: There is typically a single point of entry (the first element) and a single point of exit (the last element).

    Traversal: Linear data structures allow for easy traversal, where you can visit each element one by one, starting from one end and progressing to the other.

Common examples of linear data structures include:

    Arrays (Lists): In programming, arrays or lists are often used to represent linear data structures. Elements are stored sequentially, and you can access them by their index.

    Linked Lists: Linked lists are made up of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node. This creates a linear sequence of elements.

    Stacks: Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, which means the last element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are used for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and other LIFO scenarios.

    Queues: Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. Queues are used for tasks like managing tasks in a printer queue or handling requests in computer networks.

    Strings: Strings can be thought of as linear data structures, where characters are arranged sequentially in a specific order.

Linear data structures are fundamental in computer science and programming because they allow you to represent and process ordered data efficiently. The choice of a specific linear data structure depends on the requirements of your application and the operations you need to perform on the data.
